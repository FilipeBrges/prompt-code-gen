# Python Basics Best Practices

## Code Style and Formatting

Use PEP 8 style guide for consistent code formatting. Follow naming conventions: snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes.

## Error Handling

Always use specific exception types instead of bare except clauses. Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.

## Documentation

Write clear docstrings for all functions and classes. Use type hints to improve code readability and IDE support.

## Testing

Write unit tests for all critical functions. Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested.

## Security

Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys or passwords. Use environment variables and proper authentication mechanisms.
