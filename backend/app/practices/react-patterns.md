# React Development Patterns

## Component Structure

Create small, focused components with single responsibilities. Use functional components with hooks instead of class components.

## State Management

Use useState for local state, useContext for shared state across components. Consider state management libraries for complex applications.

## Performance

Use React.memo for expensive components, useMemo for expensive calculations, and useCallback for stable function references.

## Error Handling

Implement error boundaries to catch and handle component errors gracefully.

## TypeScript Integration

Use TypeScript with React for better type safety. Define proper interfaces for props and state.

## Testing

Write tests for components using React Testing Library. Focus on testing user interactions rather than implementation details.
